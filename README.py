# ____Project Title____
#
# Guess That Number
# This is a fairly simple number guessing game that asks a user to specify how many chances they want to guess a
# randomly generated number.
#
#
# ____Motivation____
#
# I created this project in order to practice basic python skills. I recently started learning python and wanted a
# chance to apply some of the skills I have learned and get used to the syntax.
#
#
# ____Build Status____
#
# There are no known bugs or issues with the current build
#
#
# ____Code Style____
#
# PEP 8
#
#
# ____How To Use____
#
# Simply run the progam. It is entirely based in the console so no windows will pop-up there. Just download the repository,
# copy your file path, open a command prompt, paste your file path, and hit enter. Once you are in the correct directory,
# type <python3 main.py> into the command prompt (omit <>).
#
#
# ____Future Updates____
#
# I plan to add a new "Perpetual" game mode in the near future where you gain some lives each time you guess
# the number correctly.
#
# After the perpetual game mode I plan on adding a scoring system where you can keep track of your high score
# for that session
